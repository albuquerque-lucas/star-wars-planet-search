# Star Wars Planet Search

🌌 **Project Overview - What's it about?**

Welcome to the Star Wars Planet Search project! This web application allows users to explore and filter planets from the vast Star Wars universe based on their preferences. It was developed as part of a programming course, wich was Trybe - Escola de Programação Online, where each participant created their own version of the project. This is my personal take on it, adding my own touch to the application.

🚀 Some technologies i've used:

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Hooks:** React features that allow using state and other React features in functional components.
- **Context API:** A React feature that allows sharing data between components without the need to pass props manually.
- **Star Wars API:** We used the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/api/planets) to retrieve the planet data.
