# Star Wars Planet Search

üåå **What is it about?**

Star Wars Planet Search is a web application that lists planets from the Star Wars universe, allowing users to filter the data according to their preferences. The aim of this project was to develop and test the application of filters using Hooks and Context API in the React environment. This application was the final project created during the Front-End curriculum at Trybe - School of Programming.

## Technologies Used

üöÄ Star Wars Planet Search was developed using the following technologies:

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Hooks:** React features that allow using state and other React features in functional components.
- **Context API:** A React feature that allows sharing data between components without the need to pass props manually.
- **Star Wars API:** We used the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/api/planets) to retrieve the planet data.
